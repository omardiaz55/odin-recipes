  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>To make delicious avocado toast, start by toasting two slices of whole-grain bread until they're golden and crisp. While the bread is toasting, halve a ripe avocado, remove the pit, and scoop the creamy flesh into a bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork, and then season it with a pinch of salt, a dash of freshly ground black pepper, and a squeeze of zesty lemon juice. Once the bread is ready, spread the mashed avocado evenly over the slices. For extra flavor and texture, sprinkle red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds on top. This simple yet satisfying recipe yields a nutritious and flavorful avocado toast that's perfect for a quick breakfast or snack.</p>
