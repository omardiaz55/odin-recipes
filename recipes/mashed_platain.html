  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Mangu is a beloved and iconic Dominican dish made from mashed green plantains, typically served for breakfast or as a side dish. Its smooth and creamy texture, combined with its rich flavor, makes it a comforting and satisfying staple in Dominican cuisine. </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 green plantains</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of butter or olive oil</li>
    <li>Red onion, thinly sliced (optional, for topping)</li>
    <li>Queso Frito (fried cheese) or salami (optional, for topping)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by selecting green, unripe plantains. They should be firm and have a green skin with no yellow or black spots.
      Peel the plantains by cutting off the ends and making a lengthwise slit along the ridges of the plantains. Carefully peel off the skin.</li>
    <li>Cut the plantains into chunks, about 2-inch pieces. This will help them cook evenly.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to the water.</li>
    <li>Add the plantain chunks to the boiling water and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender and easily pierced with a fork. The plantains will change from a bright green to a yellowish color.</li>
    <li>Once the plantains are cooked, carefully remove them from the water and drain.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, use a fork or a masher to mash the plantains until smooth and creamy. Some people prefer a few lumps for texture.</li>
    <li>While mashing, add butter or olive oil to the plantains. Mix well until the fat is fully incorporated and the mangu is creamy.</li>
    <li>Season the mangu with salt to taste. Adjust the seasoning based on your preference.</li>
    <li>Serve the mangu hot, topped with thinly sliced red onions, queso frito (fried cheese), or slices of salami for added flavor and texture.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Serving</h3>
  <p>Mangu is often served as a side dish with fried cheese, eggs, or salami for breakfast. It can also accompany dishes like saut√©ed red onions, fried eggs, and fried Dominican cheese. Some variations include serving it with avocado, Dominican-style eggs (huevos a la Dominicana), or alongside other typical Dominican breakfast items. Enjoy this delicious and comforting Dominican staple that offers a unique blend of flavors and textures.</p>
